# TODO

This document describes what should each version of Wary Festival accomplish.

## Version 1.0.0

The initial version should only have basic functionality. This way it should be
easy to define and acknowledge the main goal of the application.

The main application is about festivals, so one of the entities is the
festival. In fact it could be the only entity: the application could be a list
of festivals ordered by date and location.
